## Quick blurb
---
I was born and raised in Kathmandu, Nepal and moved to the United States in 2010 on the Diversity Visa lottery program. It's the only lottery I have ever won but it's the best one I could ever win. I am eternally grateful for the opportunities I have been able to pursue
since moving to the United States

I went to Paint branch high school in Burtonsville, Maryland where I graduated as the valedictorian and delivered the commencement address. 
I went on to study Computer Engineering at University of Maryland with a focus on Entrepreneurship and Innovation. It was here that I found my passion for programming and using it to affect change in developing countries like Nepal. I co-founded a reasonably successful startup called
Pinpointer where my mission was to digitize addresses in countries like Nepal where people live without an identifiable address. I put that idea on hold to focus on my education and get more experience in the industry but I would like to pursue that again someday soon

I graduated University of Maryland in 2018 and delivered the [commencement address](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxNa51UFGGI&feature=youtu.be&t=2629)

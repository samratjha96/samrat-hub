# Quick blurb
---
I was born and raised in Kathmandu, Nepal and moved to the United States in 2010 on the Diversity Visa lottery program. It's the only lottery I have won (not for a lack of trying; I have bough scratch-offs) but one I'm eternally grateful for 
as moving to the United States has allowed me to pursue opportunities that wouldn't have been possible where I was born

I went to Paint branch high school in Burtonsville, Maryland where I graduated as the valedictorian and delivered the commencement speech which was a pretty big achievement for me having immigrated to the country only a few years ago

I went on to study Computer Engineering at University of Maryland with a focus on Entrepreneurship and Innovation. It was here that I found my passion for programming 
and using it to affect change in developing countries like Nepal. I co-founded my first startup called Pinpointer where my mission was to digitize the concept of addressing in countries like Nepal where people live without an identifiable address to this day

I graduated University of Maryland in 2018 and delivered the Engineering school's [commencement address](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxNa51UFGGI&feature=youtu.be&t=2629) which was also an amazing moment for me and my family



## Interests
---
Coding and programming is a major interest of mine. I live and breathe technology and always try to learn new things about the landscape be it new tools, new frameworks or new languages. Beyond that, I like to play and watch soccer, work out, travel and obsess over my stock investments
